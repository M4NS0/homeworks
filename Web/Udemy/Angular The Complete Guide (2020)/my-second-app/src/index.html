  All documents that have component in their names, inside app folders  are related to the <app-root> component

  inside app.component.ts: 
    selector: 'app-root'
    assigns the string 'selector' as a value named 'app-root'
  
  inside app.component.html:
    contains the template of the component 
  
  When this page is inspected, in the final of the document, injection of  imports, bundles, styles can be seen
  
  inside main.ts
    in 11th line bootstraps starts inside the angular application by passing 
    the AppModule to app.module.ts though this method platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  
  inside the app.module.ts: 
    now we can see a bootstrap array inside it: bootstrap: [AppComponent] referencing the AppComponent of Angular in <app-root>
    


  the App components will not be added to index.html, their selectors will not be added here, but in the document app.component.html
