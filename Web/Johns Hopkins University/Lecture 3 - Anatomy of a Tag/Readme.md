### Anatomy of an HTML Tag

> - *Cannot place spaces between '<' and 'p' or '/p'*
```sh
    <p> Element </p>

```

> - *Tags that don't need to be closed:* 
```sh
    <br> Line Break  
    <hr> Horizontal Rule 

```

> - *Attribute name and value*
> - *The value is unique, cannot repeat the same value*
> - *Must have spaces between p and its attributes*
> - *Cannot specify an attribute out of tags*
> - *Values between single or double quotes:*
```sh
    <p id="myId"> </p>

```

> - *Inner single quotes always inside outer double quotes*
> - *Can be nested as long as it is properly closed*
```sh
    <p onclick="alert('hi')"> </p>

```

> - *Self closing tag, short notation that does not contains any content*
```sh
    <p></p>
    
```
