    <h1>ARNOLD LANE</h1>
    <div>
        <p id="p1">
            <br>Arnold Layne had a strange hobby
            <br>Collecting clothes
            <br>Moonshine, washing line
            <br>They suit him fine
            <br>On the wall, hung a tall mirror
            <br> Distorted view, see through baby blue
            <br>Oh, Arnold Layne
            <br>It's not the same, takes two to know
            <br>Two to know, two to know -
            <br>Why can't you see?
            <br>Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne,Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne
        </p>
        <p id="p2">
            <br>Now he's caught - a nasty sort of person.
            <br>They gave him time
            <br>Doors clang - chain gang - he hates it
            <br>Oh, Arnold Layne
            <br>It's not the same, takes two to know
            <br>Two to know, two to know
            <br>Why can't you see?
            <br>Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne,
            <br>Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne
            <br>
            <br>Don't do it again
        </p>
