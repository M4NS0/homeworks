    <h1>Cascade of CSS Exemple</h1>
    <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
    <p>Inheritance allow to write more global styles on parent elements and then "fine-tune" the styles for some of the child elements as needed. Such approach makes writing CSS very efficient.

        <br>Arnold Layne had a strange hobby
        <br>Collecting clothes
        <br>Moonshine, washing line
        <br>They suit him fine
        <br>On the wall, hung a tall mirror
        <br>Distorted view, see through baby blue
        <br>Oh, Arnold Layne
        <br> It's not the same, takes two to know
        <br>Two to know, two to know -
        <br>Why can't you see?
        <br>Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne</p>
