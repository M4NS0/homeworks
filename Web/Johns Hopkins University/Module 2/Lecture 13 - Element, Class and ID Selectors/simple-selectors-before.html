    <h1>Effervescing Elephant (h1) </h1>
    <h2>Part 1 (h2/highlight) </h2>
    <p class="highlight"> An Effervescing Elephant with tiny eyes and great big trunk once whispered to the tiny ear the ear of one inferior that by next June he'd die, oh yeah!</p>
    <p class="highlight"> because the tiger would roam. The little one said: "Oh my goodness I must stay at home! and every time I hear a growl I'll know the tiger's on the prowl and I'll be really safe, you know the elephant he told me so." Everyone was nervy, oh yeah!</p>

    <h2>Part 2 (h2/p) </h2>
    <p> and the message was spread to zebra, mongoose, and the dirty hippopotamus who wallowed in the mud and chewed his spicy hippo-plankton food and tended to ignore the word preferring to survey a herd of stupid water bison, oh yeah!</p>
    <p> And all the jungle took fright, and ran around for all the day and the night but all in vain, because, you see, the tiger came and said: "Who me?! You know, I wouldn't hurt not one of you. I'd much prefer something to chew</p>
