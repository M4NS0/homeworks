    <h1>Syd Barret Songs</h1>
    <h2>GOLDEN HAIR</h2>
    <h2>(These lyrics are originally from "Chamber Music" by James Joyce (1907)</h2>
    <p>Lean out your window, golden hair
        <br> I heard you singing in the midnight air
        <br>my book is closed, I read no more
        <br>watching the fire dance, on the floor
        <br>I've left my book, I've left my room</p>
    <br />
    <h2> SEE EMILY PLAY</h2>
    <h2>(Single)</h2>
    <p style="text-align: right;">
        <br>Emily tries but misunderstands, ah ooh
        <br>She often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow
        <br>There is no other day
        <br>Let's try it another way
        <br>You'll lose your mind at play
        <br>Free games till may
        <br>See Emily play
        <br>Soon after dark Emily cries, ah ooh
        <br>Gazing through trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow
        <br>There is no other day
        <br>Let's try it another way
        <br>You'll lose your mind and play
        <br>Free games for may
        <br>See Emily play
        <br>Put on a gown that touches the ground, ah ooh
        <br>Float on a river forever and ever, Emily
        <br>There is no other day
        <br>Let's try it another way
        <br>You'll lose your mind and play
        <br>Free games for may
        <br>See Emily play
    </p>
