    The Scarecrow
    <header class="navigation">
        <p class="blurb">
            <br>The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
            <br>Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere.
            <br>He didn't care.
            <br>He stood in a field where barley grows.
            <br>
            <br>His head did no thinking
            <br>His arms didn't move except when the wind cut up
            <br>Rough and mice ran around on the ground
            <br>He stood in a field where barley grows.
            <br>
            <br>The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
            <br>But now he's resigned to his fate
            <br>'Cause life's not unkind - he doesn't mind.
            <br>He stood in a field where barley grows.
        </p>
