    <h1 class="highlight"> Effervescing Elephant </h1>
    <p>An Effervescing Elephant with tiny eyes and great big trunk once whispered to the tiny ear the ear of one inferior that by next June he'd die, oh yeah!</p>
    <p class="highlight">because the tiger would roam. The little one said: "Oh my goodness I must stay at home! and every time I hear a growl I'll know the tiger's on the prowl and I'll be really safe, you know the elephant he told me so." Everyone was nervy, oh yeah!</p>
    <div class="mainpoint highlight">and the message was spread to zebra, mongoose, and the dirty hippopotamus who wallowed in the mud and chewed his spicy hippo-plankton food and tended to ignore the word preferring to survey a herd of stupid water bison, oh yeah!</div>
