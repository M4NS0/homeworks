>     Visit with the client most clients have no idea what they want
>     It’s your job to ask questions to figure it out!

>     Bring web site examples of similar businesses
>     Less is more! 
> 
>     Encourage your client not to cram information on the site 
>     Client should invest in the project

>     Have client designate one person responsible for decisions
>
>     Limit number of revisions upfront 
>     If it’s a paying job, limit number of FREE revisions
