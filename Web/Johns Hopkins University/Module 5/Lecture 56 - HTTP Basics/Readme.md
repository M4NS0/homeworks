> Essentially a client-server communication technique
>
> Based on request/ressponse stateless protocol
>
> Stateless in this context means that when the server responds
to a request from a browser, that response does not depend on any previous requests that the browser made
>
> the HTTP protocol is stateless. There's nothing inherently in it that remembers that you are the same person who requested or made that request between the browser and the server a couple of minutes ago
>
> * Client opens connection to the server
> * Client sends HTTP request for a resource
> * Server sends HTTP response to the cliente with resource
> * Client closes the connection to server
